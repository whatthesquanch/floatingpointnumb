# floatingpointnumb

This program takes five floating-point values from the user, calculates the total, average, maximum, minimum, and interest on the total at 20%, and prints the results. The while-loop ensures that the program continues to prompt the user until five valid inputs are received.

Initialize total to 0
Initialize max to negative infinity
Initialize min to positive infinity
Initialize count to 0

While count is less than 5:
Print "Enter a floating-point value:"
If user input is a valid floating-point number:
Read the value
Update total by adding the value
Update max if the value is greater than max
Update min if the value is less than min
Increment count by 1
Else:
Print "Invalid input. Please enter a valid floating-point value."

Calculate average by dividing total by 5
Calculate interest as 20% of total

Print "Total: " concatenated with total
Print "Average: " concatenated with average
Print "Maximum: " concatenated with max
Print "Minimum: " concatenated with min
Print "Interest on total at 20%: " concatenated with interest
